# Stop Using AI

## Description

The **Stop Using AI** extension is designed to help developers think critically and solve errors on their own before turning to AI for help. Instead of immediately copying and pasting an error into an AI tool, this extension encourages you to take time to analyze and troubleshoot the issue first.

## Features

- Provides a command: **"Start Using Your Brain"**
- Opens a dedicated page within VS Code to document your thought process
- Starts a **30-minute timer** for focused troubleshooting
- Allows you to manually **click "Done"** if you solve the problem before the timer ends
